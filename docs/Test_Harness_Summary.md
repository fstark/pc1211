# PC-1211 BASIC Test Harness - Summary

## What We Built

A comprehensive test harness system to support refactoring the PC-1211 BASIC interpreter while maintaining reliability as a reference implementation for assembly development.

## Key Components

### 1. Python Test Harness (`test_harness.py`)
- **72 test files** automatically discovered and executed
- **Smart classification** of expected pass/fail based on naming patterns  
- **Reference baseline system** with JSON storage and MD5 comparison
- **Timeout handling** for INPUT tests and infinite loops
- **Detailed reporting** with execution times and error analysis

### 2. Shell Wrapper (`run_tests.sh`)
- **Automatic building** when source files change
- **Simple commands**: `run`, `save`, `compare`, `quick`
- **CI-friendly** with proper exit codes

### 3. Reference Storage (`test_references.json`)
- **Baseline outputs** for all 72 tests
- **Regression detection** via output comparison
- **Performance tracking** with execution times

## Current Test Status

âœ… **All tests working as expected**
- **Total tests**: 72
- **Passing**: 62 (normal operation tests)
- **Failing**: 10 (error tests, INPUT timeouts - all expected)
- **Unexpected failures**: 0 

## Usage for Refactoring

### Before Major Changes
```bash
./run_tests.sh save    # Create baseline
```

### After Refactoring
```bash  
./run_tests.sh compare # Check for regressions
```

### Quick Validation
```bash
./run_tests.sh quick   # Fast summary
```

## Benefits for Reference Implementation

1. **Confidence in Changes**: Can refactor large functions knowing all behavior is preserved
2. **Regression Prevention**: Immediate detection of broken functionality  
3. **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable specification of PC-1211 BASIC behavior
4. **Quality Assurance**: Edge cases and error conditions thoroughly tested

## Next Steps - Refactoring Priorities

Based on the code quality analysis, the test harness now enables tackling these improvements:

### 1. Function Decomposition (Critical)
- Break down the massive `vm_execute_statement()` function
- Extract each case into focused, testable functions
- **Test harness ensures no behavior changes**

### 2. Code Deduplication (Critical)  
- Eliminate mathematical function parsing duplication
- Create common helper functions
- **Regression testing prevents introduction of bugs**

### 3. Additional Improvements
- Magic number elimination
- Enhanced error messages  
- Code documentation

The test harness provides the safety net needed to confidently refactor this interpreter while maintaining its goal as a reliable reference for assembly implementation on real PC-1211 hardware.
